Deployment & Upgrades
#####################

Initial deployment
==================

The deployment of the ITSI module for Telegraf OS is extremely straight forward.

**Deploy the ITSI module using one of the following options:**

- Using the application manager in Splunk Web (Settings / Manages apps)

- Extracting the content of the tgz archive in the "apps" directory of Splunk

- For SHC configurations (Search Head Cluster), extract the tgz content in the SHC deployer and publish the SHC bundle

Upgrades
========

Upgrading the ITSI module is pretty much the same operation, use one of the techniques that matches your conditions / requirements.
